The program start by setting up its memory and loading necessary shared libraries, then
It checks for the existence of the "/etc/ld.so.preload" file and opens the
"/etc/ld.so.cache" and the "libc.so.6" library.
Memory mappings for these libraries are set up, including read and execute permissions.
The program sets memory protection on different regions and sets a stack size limit, then,
the program verifies that a directory named "./welcomeToDevOpsTheHardWay" exists and generates random bytes
with "getrandom".
It then opens a file named "goodLuck" within the "welcomeToDevOpsTheHardWay"
directory for writing.
The program writes the message "There you go... tell me what I do" into this file.

Kernel System Calls
-------------------
The program start by setting up its memory and loading necessary shared libraries, then
It checks for the existence of the "/etc/ld.so.preload" file and opens the
"/etc/ld.so.cache" and the "libc.so.6" library.
Memory mappings for these libraries are set up, including read and execute permissions.
The program sets memory protection on different regions and sets a stack size limit, then,
the program verifies that a directory named "./welcomeToDevOpsTheHardWay" exists and generates random bytes
with "getrandom".
It then opens a file named "goodLuck" within the "welcomeToDevOpsTheHardWay"
directory for writing.
The program writes the message "There you go... tell me what I do" into this file.


Broken Symlink
-------------------
What happened is that we broke the link where we changed the path of the link.
To fix that, we need to create a new link with the current path of the directory.



Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 7, 4, 22.
2. 0-255 (11111111).
3. Positive number and negative number, for example:
    Representing -127:
    - Positive 127 in binary: 001111111.
    - Invert the bits: 110000000.
    - Add 1 to the least significant bit: 110000001 = this represented -127.
4. IEEE Standard 754 Floating Point Numbers.
